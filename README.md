<h2>Welcome</h2> 

- 💻 I’m currently working on SAP UI5 apps for Atlas Copco
- 🦀 I’m learning Rust on my free time
- ⁉️ Ask me about my new website/blog that's under development

My pinned repos are some of my best work, but the are getting old and out of date now. I'm working on some new stuff as well as looking into 
getting into more open source. I mostly work with front end web technologies but am not afraid to dive into some backend. 

Update to https://mikecurry.dev coming soon!
